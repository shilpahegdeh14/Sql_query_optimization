# SQL Query Optimization

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to the exploration and optimization of SQL queries to improve their performance. The focus is on tuning queries to enhance execution times and overall efficiency. By employing various techniques such as indexing, query restructuring, and utilizing database features (EXPLAIN, ANALAYZE, CACHING) effectively, I have aimed to achieve optimal results.

## Contents

1. **Queries:**
   - Contains the original SQL queries that are subject to optimization.

2. **Indexing:**
   - Investigates the impact of indexing on query performance.

3. **Analysis:**
   - Provides detailed analysis and query plans before and after optimization attempts.

4. **Results:**
   - Summarizes the performance results, including execution times and any notable improvements.

## Key Files

- **SQL files in the format <sql_tuning_query_question_number.sql> containing both with and without indexing sql queries:**
  - Holds the initial set of SQL queries that are the focus of optimization.
  - Explores the effects of indexing on query performance.

- **DBLP dataset_sql_tuning_report.docx:**
  - Contains detailed analysis, query plans, and explanations for each optimization attempt.
  - Summarizes the performance results and highlights any improvements achieved.
